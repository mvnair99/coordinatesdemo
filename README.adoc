This application will randomly generate coordinate points. For simplicity and time limitiations, making use of H2 database used with JPA.
Also to determine is a coordinate is within the United States, there is an external dependecny on Mapquest web services. To use this service,
the use of a license key is required.

1.) Select how many coordinate records to be generated by adding value within application.properties

2.) It has rest endpoints that allow clients to
* Add a coordinate
* Determine if the coordinate exists
* Distance from Tokyo, Riyadh, Sydney, Zurich, Lima, Mexico City, and Reykjavik. Please see attached PostMan collection for samples

3.) To run, open up in IntelliJ or your IDE of choice. It is a Spring Boot project so most common IDEs should load this project. Run the CoordinatesApp
4.) The app will generate the random coordinates for you. After generating them, it will go through each and determine if in the US or not. If not in the US, it will show the distance to the different cities.


Potential Future Improvements
1.) Remove Mapquest dependency with a homegrown solution. Using known US coordinates and polygons to solver perimeter problems.
2.) Better error handling
3.) JUnits. Currently tested out using the attached Postman collection
4.) Use a cache for certain ranges
5.) Better readme document :-)
